Hi, 

the Wagendorf Forum is a small Forum extension unsing three Special Pages making a  nice forum in your Wiki, 
it is still very crappy code, but almost localized. 

INSTALL:

1. untar the archive in your MediaWiki Document Root.  

2. create the forum tables:

create table forum_thread (
       id INT(5) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       user INT(5),
       topic VARCHAR(255),
       relevance DATETIME,
       article_count INT(5),
       view_count INT(5)
    );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

create table forum_article (
       id INT(5) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       user INT(5),
       date DATETIME,
       thread INT(5) NOT NULL,
       topic VARCHAR(255),
       text TEXT
    );


3. do an include("extensions/Forum.php"); in your LocalSettings.php

4. Pray

PROBLEMS:

This is still a german Wiki, so you may have to localize it by yourself, and maybe 
it will not work in your environment.

If you found a Bug, please report it to: zem_at_messwagen42.de 

USAGE: 

you can either use the Special page Special:Forum or you can display the last 10 topics of the 
forum on a wiki page by using 

<showforum></showforum>

you can show a thread within a discussion page by making a tag like 

<showthread>number</showthread>

where number is the thread number, for example to show thread 5 use: 

<showthread>5</showthread>

best regards
